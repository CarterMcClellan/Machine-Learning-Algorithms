# Machine Learning Basics
- **DL**; basic architectures (MLP, RNN, LSTM, GRU, ResNet), regularizers, and normalization
- **ML**; tree based (Decision Trees, Random Forest, GBM), bayesian techniques, linear families, and kernel methods
- **NA**; matrix methods (SVM, QR, Jordan), optimizers (Newton, SGD, Adam), loss functions (Entropy, KL, NLL)
